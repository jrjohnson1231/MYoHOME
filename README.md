# MYoHOME
2015 AT&amp;T Hackathon at Notre Dame, Grand Prize Winner

MYoHOME connects the Myo Remote armband to the AT&T digital life home system. With a few simple hand gestures, users can control the lights, door locks, and designated AT&T SmartPlugs. Tying it all together is the Night Mode feature that allows a user to turn off all the lights, lock the door, and turn on a nightligt all in the palm of ones hand, literally. The app features a simple UI that allows the user to connect to a Myo armband via bluetooth. It also displays the current state of each feature, and shows the user the different gestures available. The app is best used running in the background to allow users to control their homes without needing to have ones phone out all the time. The app sends unique vibrations back to the Myo to give the user confirmation a gesture has been recieved and the corresponding command executed. In addition, the Myo must be unlocked by the Double Tap command, preventing the user from making unwanted gestures during everyday use.

NOTE: The app is dependent upon authorization to the AT&T Digital Life API. This authorization was only available during the hackathon, therefore the app is no longer able to run. A screenshot of the UI has been included in this repository for viewing.
